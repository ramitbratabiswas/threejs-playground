# three.js playground
A collection of mini three.js projects, each based on FreeCodeCamp's tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMqNHi1GDAE).

1. playground: consists of a sphere and a box and three different lights; allows the user to play around with different colours and intensities for the lights and textures for the sphere; uses the dat.gui library to create sliders and toggles
2. vortex: depicts a ball falling through a glowing vortex with the camera following along; involves post-processing with unreal bloom pass
3. floating shapes: randomly generates 3D shapes and applies a changing transition effect on the scene
4. globe: a rotating 3D model of the earth

work in progress: planning to try out more Three.js effects and use those for my portfolio site; will add more options to the playground, e.g adding and removing shapes, lights, etc.
